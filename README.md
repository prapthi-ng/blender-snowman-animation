# blender-snowman-animation

This mini project demonstrates basic animation principles using Blender:
- Object parenting
- Rotation and jump animation
- Intentional timing (90° rotations)
- Snowfall effect
- Text appearance (“Happy New Year”)

The animation was created as part of my learning journey toward
Pipeline Development and Technical Animation.

Animation preview is provided via screen recording.
